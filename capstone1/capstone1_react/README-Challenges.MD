Challenges

    1. The first Challenge was that there was a lot of stuff that I didn't know about slash remember when getting started. (Example my project would have went smoother if I remembered useContext)

    2. The second Challenge was just learning the various .map,.filter., and .find. Once I learned these things went smooth.

    3. Last Challenge was just the amount of time it took to complete the assignment. By the end of it I did not have enough time to complete every function. (It was like the last day that I learned what useContext was, which would have made almost everything easier)
