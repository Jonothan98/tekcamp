Accordion Challenges
    - The biggest challenge I had was figuring out how to make answers show for the item I clicked. (Ex. at the start when I clicked the last question the answer for the first question would appear)
    - The next challenge I had was figuring out how to go about toggling the items to look like the image provided in the design doc. (I was able to accomplish this from what I learned working on form validation)
    - The Accordion assignment went by smoothing thanks to what I learned working on the form validation

    - I used the provided JavaScript Udemy tutorial, mainly the DOM selectors, Traversing the DOM, and the  Event Bubbling secions (https://teksystems.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757272#overview)
    - I also used W3 javaScript DOM section (https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
    - I also used this code as the basis of my toggleDropBox function (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_hide_show.asp)
    - My group mates (Alan, Joseph, and Rami) help me with the Form Valiadtion, and I was able to apply that knowledge to this assignment.
