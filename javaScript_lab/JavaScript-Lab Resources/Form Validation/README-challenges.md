Challenges
    - The biggest challenge I had revolved around email, and borders. I had everything working but these two.
    - Alan, Rami and Joseph helped me resolve these issues. They help me simplify my code as I had two extra variables made and had my if loop(to check email) within the for loop.
    - Alan also showed me the Add() and remove() commands that solved my border issue.
    - I also spent a large amount of time trying to figure out how to change the placeholder text to red and read as "email@example/com". Alan was the one to point out to me that the red text show in the design document is the user input and not the placeholder text. 
    - So once I learned the add and remove commands and that I didn't need to change the color of the placeholder text it was smooth sailing.

Sources
    - I used the provided JavaScript Udemy tutorial, mainly the DOM selectors, Traversing the DOM, and the  Event Bubbling secions (https://teksystems.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757272#overview)
    - I also used W3 javaScript DOM section (https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
    - My group mates (Alan, Joseph, and Rami) helped me with simplifying/cleaning up my code and showing me the add and remove functions.
    - The regex fomula used to check email validation was used from : https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php
