Challenges
 -One challenged I faced was that my preplanning could have been better. I made a UML and a flowchart but as I was working on the project I learned about easier ways and more effective ways to do things. Which made me change what I was doing compared to the design documents.
 -Another challegned I faced was UI.I made enums for all items and classes for sandwiches and plates, following that I had to get the user information to pick everything and I did not do it well. the UI class looks very messy and if I had more time I would probably retackle that class to make it cleaner.

 Sources
 - After Rami notified me about Enums I used this video to help me implement it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq9SJb8VeyM)
 - This udemy source gave me the idea on how to make the Sandwich and Plates class (https://teksystems.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/lecture/3824746#overview)
 - I used this source to get the current time and date for the Receipt (https://www.javatpoint.com/java-get-current-date)
 - I had replaced a lot of if else statements  with switch statements. Since I was not to comfortable with them I used this source to help me (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html)
