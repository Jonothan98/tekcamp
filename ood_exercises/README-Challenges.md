Challenges
 - For this exercise the biggest challenge was testing as I am still not too familiar with it.

 Sources

 - May main source for this assignment was the Udemy course. All of the sections in the Udemy that cover the patterns we used in the assignment were helpful. (https://teksystems.udemy.com/course/java-design-patterns/learn/lecture/9672584#overview)
