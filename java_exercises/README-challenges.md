Challenges
    - One of the biggest challenges was just trying to wrap my head around the logic some of these exercises want. It became a lot easier to understand when attending office hours and they explained what they wanted the exercise to accomplish.
    - Another challenges after understanding the logic is how do you go about applying that to the excercise.
    - There was another challenge with exercise 4 where I thought I was having a logic issue with my code, but after going to office hours it turned out my code was right. It was just I was outputing the board and hop wrong in main. So I spent a lot of time on the hop method to find out I was actually right the whole time.
    - For testing I was unsure that I tested every method that needed testing.
